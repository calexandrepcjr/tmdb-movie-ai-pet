## üèóÔ∏è Fundamental Prompting Principles

### 1. **Provide Rich Context**
Always include:
- Project architecture (DDD + Clean Architecture)
- TypeScript requirements
- Existing patterns and conventions
- Specific constraints and requirements

### 2. **Be Specific and Detailed**
- Specify exact requirements
- Include examples of desired output
- Define acceptance criteria
- Mention error handling requirements

### 3. **Reference Existing Patterns**
- Point to similar existing implementations
- Maintain consistency with project standards
- Follow established naming conventions

### 4. **üö´ ANTI-VIBE CODING PROMPTING**
**CRITICAL**: Never use vague or intuition-based prompts. All prompts must follow augmented coding principles.

#### ‚ùå Prohibited Vibe Prompts:
- "Make this better"
- "Fix this code"
- "Create something like this"
- "Implement a quick solution"
- "Generate code that works"

#### ‚úÖ Required Augmented Prompts:
- "Analyze this code against [specific criteria] and propose improvements"
- "Refactor this code to follow [specific pattern] while maintaining [specific requirements]"
- "Create [specific component] following [existing pattern] with [explicit requirements]"
- "Design a solution for [specific problem] considering [architectural constraints]"
- "Generate code that implements [specific interface] with [validation requirements]"

#### Mandatory Prompt Elements:
1. **Context**: Specific project context and constraints
2. **Analysis**: Request for problem analysis before solution
3. **Standards**: Reference to existing patterns and standards
4. **Validation**: Criteria for evaluating the solution
5. **Documentation**: Request for explanation of decisions

## üéØ Context-Setting Templates

### Base Project Context
```
Context: TMDB Movie Client - TypeScript Project
Architecture: Domain-Driven Design + Clean Architecture
Layers:
- Domain: Entities, Value Objects, Repository Interfaces
- Application: Use Cases, DTOs, Application Services
- Infrastructure: Repository Implementations, HTTP Clients, Configuration
- Presentation: CLI (Node.js) and Browser (React) interfaces

Key Patterns:
- Repository pattern for data access
- Use case pattern for business operations
- Dependency injection for loose coupling
- Interface segregation for testability

TypeScript Requirements:
- Strict type checking enabled
- Interfaces for all contracts (NO Hungarian notation - use descriptive names like ConfigurationService, not IConfigService)
- File naming must use PascalCase (e.g., UserService.ts, MovieRepository.ts)
- Proper error handling with custom exceptions
- JSDoc comments for public APIs
```

### Architecture-Specific Context
```
Clean Architecture Rules:
1. Dependencies point inward (Infrastructure ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Domain)
2. Domain layer has no external dependencies
3. Application layer depends only on domain interfaces
4. Infrastructure implements domain interfaces
5. Presentation depends on application use cases

Current Project Structure:
[Include relevant folder structure]
```

### Augmented Code Generation Strategy
**MANDATORY**: All code generation must follow this structured approach:

#### Phase 1: Analysis and Planning
```
Before generating any code, please:
1. Analyze the problem domain and requirements
2. Identify existing patterns that apply
3. Determine architectural layer placement
4. Plan integration points with existing code
5. Identify potential risks and trade-offs

Problem: [Specific problem description]
Context: [Project context and constraints]

```

#### Phase 2: Design Validation
```
Based on the analysis, design the solution:
1. Define interfaces and contracts
2. Plan error handling strategy
3. Design testing approach
4. Validate against architectural principles
5. Document design decisions

Do not proceed to implementation without explicit approval of this design.
```

#### Phase 3: Implementation with Validation
```
Generate the implementation with:
1. Complete TypeScript types and interfaces
2. Comprehensive error handling
3. JSDoc documentation
4. Unit tests for all public methods
5. Integration tests where applicable

After generation, provide:
- Explanation of key design decisions
- Validation against architectural principles
- Testing strategy recommendations
- Potential improvement areas
```

### Refactoring Prompts
```
Refactor this code to better follow our architecture:

Current Code: [paste code]

Analysis Required:

2. Specific improvements needed
3. Impact on existing integrations
4. Testing requirements for changes
5. Migration strategy if needed

Improvements needed:
1. Better separation of concerns
2. Proper error handling
3. Type safety improvements
4. Testability enhancements
5. Documentation updates

Architecture rules: [reference specific rules]
Existing patterns: [reference patterns to follow]

DO NOT provide refactored code until the analysis is complete and approved.
```
