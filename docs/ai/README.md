## üèóÔ∏è AI Integration Principles

### 1. **AI as Assistant, Not Replacement**
- AI should augment developer capabilities, not replace critical thinking
- Always review and understand AI-generated code
- Maintain architectural consistency and project standards

### 2. **Context-Aware Development**
- Provide relevant project context to AI tools
- Reference existing patterns and conventions
- Align AI suggestions with project architecture

### 3. **Incremental Enhancement**
- Use AI for specific tasks rather than complete features
- Build upon AI suggestions with domain knowledge
- Iterate and refine AI-generated solutions

### 4. **üö´ STRICT NO-VIBE CODING POLICY**
**Vibe coding** (coding based on intuition without proper analysis) is strictly prohibited. All development must follow an **augmented coding strategy**.

#### What is Vibe Coding (PROHIBITED):
- Writing code based on "gut feeling" or intuition
- Making architectural decisions without proper analysis
- Copying code patterns without understanding their purpose
- Implementing solutions without considering trade-offs
- Using AI suggestions without validation and testing

#### Augmented Coding Strategy (REQUIRED):
1. **Analyze First**: Understand the problem domain and requirements
2. **Research Patterns**: Study existing code patterns and architectural decisions
3. **Plan Structure**: Design the solution following established principles
4. **Validate Approach**: Review against architecture and business requirements
5. **Implement Incrementally**: Build with proper testing and validation
6. **Document Decisions**: Record rationale for future reference

#### Enforcement Guidelines:
- ‚ùå **Never accept AI code without understanding its purpose**
- ‚ùå **Never implement without considering architectural impact**
- ‚ùå **Never skip validation steps for "quick fixes"**
- ‚úÖ **Always validate AI suggestions against project standards**
- ‚úÖ **Always test and document implementation decisions**
- ‚úÖ **Always consider long-term maintainability**

## üí° Effective Prompting Strategies

### Domain-Driven Design Context
```
Context: This is a TypeScript project using Domain-Driven Design with Clean Architecture.
The project has these layers:
- Domain: entities, value objects, repository interfaces
- Application: use cases, DTOs
- Infrastructure: repository implementations, HTTP clients
- Presentation: CLI and browser interfaces

Task: [Specific request]
Requirements: [Specific constraints]
```

### Augmented Coding Approach
**CRITICAL**: All AI interactions must follow the augmented coding strategy:

#### 1. **Analysis-First Prompting**
```
Before generating code, help me analyze:
1. Problem domain and business requirements
2. Existing architectural patterns that apply
3. Potential impact on current system design
4. Trade-offs and alternative approaches
5. Testing and validation requirements

Context: [Provide specific context]
Problem: [Describe the specific problem]
```

#### 2. **Pattern-Based Prompting**
```
Generate code following these established patterns:
- Existing pattern: [Reference specific existing code]
- Architecture layer: [Specify which layer]
- Design principles: [List relevant principles]
- Integration points: [Specify dependencies]
- Validation requirements: [List what needs validation]

DO NOT generate code that:
- Violates architectural boundaries
- Introduces new patterns without justification
- Skips error handling or validation
- Lacks proper TypeScript typing
```

#### 3. **Validation-Driven Prompting**
```
After generating the code, provide:
1. Explanation of design decisions made
2. How it fits into existing architecture
3. Potential risks or trade-offs
4. Testing strategy recommendations
5. Documentation requirements

Code: [Generated code]
Validate against: [List specific criteria]
```

### Architecture-Specific Prompts
```
I need to implement a new feature following our existing patterns:
- Repository pattern for data access
- Use case pattern for business logic
- Dependency injection for loose coupling
- TypeScript interfaces for contracts

Example: Create a new TvShowRepository following the MovieRepository pattern.
```

### Code Review Prompts
```
Please review this code for:
1. Adherence to Clean Architecture principles
2. TypeScript best practices
3. Error handling patterns
4. Testing considerations
5. Performance implications

Code: [paste code here]
```

## üîß Code Generation Best Practices

### 1. **Start with Interfaces**
- Generate interfaces before implementations
- Ensure type safety and contracts
- Follow existing interface patterns

### 2. **Follow Existing Patterns**
- Reference existing similar implementations
- Maintain consistency with project conventions
- Use established error handling patterns

### 3. **Include Proper Error Handling**
```typescript
// Good AI prompt
Generate a repository method that:
- Follows the existing error handling pattern
- Throws domain-specific exceptions
- Includes proper TypeScript types
- Has JSDoc comments
```

### 4. **Generate Complete Units**
- Generate complete methods/classes, not fragments
- Include necessary imports
- Add appropriate tests

## ‚úÖ Review and Validation Process

### AI-Generated Code Checklist
- [ ] **Architecture Compliance**: Follows DDD and Clean Architecture
- [ ] **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript usage
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Consistent error patterns
- [ ] **Testing**: Testable design and test coverage
- [ ] **Documentation**: Clear comments and documentation
- [ ] **Performance**: No obvious performance issues
- [ ] **Security**: No security vulnerabilities

### Validation Steps
1. **Static Analysis**: Run TypeScript compiler and linters
2. **Unit Tests**: Generate and run comprehensive tests
3. **Integration Tests**: Test with existing components
4. **Architecture Review**: Ensure architectural consistency
5. **Performance Check**: Verify performance implications

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture-Aware Prompting

### Domain Layer Prompts
```
Create a domain entity that:
- Has proper encapsulation
- Includes business logic validation
- Uses value objects for complex types
- Follows the existing entity patterns
```

### Application Layer Prompts
```
Generate a use case that:
- Orchestrates domain operations
- Uses repository interfaces
- Returns proper DTOs
- Handles errors appropriately
```

### Infrastructure Layer Prompts
```
Implement a repository that:
- Implements the domain interface
- Uses the HTTP client pattern
- Handles API errors properly
- Maps external data to domain entities
```

## üß™ Testing with AI

### Test Generation Strategy
```
Generate comprehensive tests for this [component/service/use case]:
- Unit tests for all public methods
- Mock external dependencies
- Test both success and error scenarios
- Follow existing test patterns
- Use TypeScript test utilities
```

### Test Coverage Areas
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing
- **Integration Tests**: Component interaction testing
- **Contract Tests**: Interface compliance testing
- **Error Scenario Tests**: Error handling validation

## üìö Documentation with AI

### Documentation Generation
```
Generate documentation for this component that includes:
- Purpose and responsibility
- Usage examples
- Interface documentation
- Configuration options
- Error scenarios
```

### ADR Generation
```
Create an ADR for this architectural decision:
- Context: [background and problem]
- Decision: [what we decided]
- Consequences: [benefits and trade-offs]
- Alternatives: [other options considered]
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls

### 1. **Over-Reliance on AI**
- Don't accept AI suggestions without understanding
- Validate architectural decisions independently
- Maintain human oversight for critical decisions

### 2. **Context Loss**
- Provide sufficient project context
- Reference existing patterns and conventions
- Ensure AI understands project constraints

### 3. **Inconsistent Patterns**
- Review AI code for pattern consistency
- Align with existing project standards
- Don't mix different architectural approaches

### 4. **Incomplete Error Handling**
- Ensure AI-generated code handles errors properly
- Follow project error handling patterns
- Test error scenarios thoroughly

### 5. **Missing Type Safety**
- Verify TypeScript types are correct
- Ensure proper interface usage
- Check for type safety violations

### 6. **üö® VIBE CODING VIOLATIONS (CRITICAL)**
These are serious violations that must be avoided:

#### Red Flags - Stop Immediately:
- ‚ùå **"This looks right"** without analysis
- ‚ùå **"Let's try this approach"** without validation
- ‚ùå **"I'll fix it later"** for architectural decisions
- ‚ùå **"It works on my machine"** without testing
- ‚ùå **"Quick and dirty solution"** for production code

#### Mandatory Prevention Steps:
1. **Pause and Analyze**: Before writing any code, understand the problem
2. **Research First**: Check existing patterns and architectural decisions
3. **Plan the Solution**: Design before implementing
4. **Validate Early**: Test assumptions and architectural fit
5. **Document Rationale**: Record why decisions were made

#### Escalation Process:
- If unsure about architectural impact: **Stop and consult documentation**
- If tempted to skip validation: **Mandatory pause and review**
- If considering "quick fix": **Requires architectural review**
- If AI suggests unfamiliar patterns: **Research and validate first**

#### Code Review Enforcement:
- All pull requests must include **design rationale**
- Reviewers must verify **architectural compliance**
- Any "vibe coding" patterns result in **immediate rejection**
- Documentation must explain **why**, not just **what**
