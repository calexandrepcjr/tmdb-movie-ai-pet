# ADR-001: Adopt Domain-Driven Design Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The TMDB Movie Client needs a robust architecture that can handle complex business logic while remaining maintainable and testable. The application deals with multiple entities (Movies, TV Shows, People) and their relationships, requiring clear domain boundaries and business rules.

## Decision
We will adopt Domain-Driven Design (DDD) as the primary architectural approach for the TMDB Movie Client. This includes:

- **Domain Layer**: Contains entities, value objects, and business rules
- **Application Layer**: Contains use cases and application services
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Contains external dependencies and implementations
- **Presentation Layer**: Contains UI components and user interaction logic

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- Clear separation of business logic from technical concerns
- Improved testability through isolated domain logic
- Better maintainability with explicit domain boundaries
- Easier to understand and modify business rules
- Supports multiple presentation layers (CLI, Browser)

### Negative Consequences
- Increased initial complexity for simple operations
- More boilerplate code compared to simpler architectures
- Steeper learning curve for developers new to DDD

## Implementation
The project structure reflects DDD principles:

```
src/
├── domain/
│   ├── entities/           # Domain entities
│   ├── value-objects/      # Value objects and errors
│   ├── repositories/       # Repository interfaces
│   └── services/           # Domain services
├── application/
│   ├── use-cases/          # Application use cases
│   └── dtos/               # Data transfer objects
├── infrastructure/
│   ├── repositories/       # Repository implementations
│   ├── http/               # HTTP clients
│   └── config/             # Configuration services
└── presentation/
    ├── cli/                # CLI interface
    └── browser/            # Browser interface
```

## Alternatives Considered
- **MVC Pattern**: Simpler but would mix business logic with presentation
- **Layered Architecture**: Less explicit about domain boundaries
- **Microservices**: Overkill for a client application
