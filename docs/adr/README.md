## üîç ADR Guidelines

### When to Create an ADR
- Significant architectural changes
- Technology stack decisions
- Design pattern adoptions
- Major refactoring decisions
- API design choices

### ADR Process
1. **Identify** the architectural decision needed
2. **Research** alternatives and trade-offs
3. **Draft** ADR using the [template](./template.md)
4. **Review** with team members
5. **Accept** and implement the decision
6. **Update** this index

### ADR Status Definitions
- **Proposed**: Decision is being considered
- **Accepted**: Decision is approved and implemented
- **Rejected**: Decision was considered but not adopted
- **Deprecated**: Decision is no longer relevant
- **Superseded**: Decision replaced by newer ADR
